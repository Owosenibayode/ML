Spark ML Algorithm That Predicts COVID-19 Patients Fatalities
The COVID19 pandemic has been devastating for hospitals as limited resources can be stretched. One area of work that is being investigated is the use of simulators that can determine the number of active cases likely to happen at a hospital â€“ for example http://covid19simulator.ca/
This simulator uses machine learning algorithms to predict number of patients that may possibly enter into a hospital in the process helping hospitals predict their resource needs. In this assignment, you will try to run a machine learning algorithm in Spark that predicts fatalities.
The following is a dataset from the city of Toronto on COVID19 cases https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto/
